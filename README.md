**Dataset Information **

Fisher's Iris dataset was introduced by the statistician Ronald Fisher in a 1936 paper called "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis is the method used in statistics and other fields to find a linear combination of features that characterises or seperates two or more classes of objects or events.    
The dataset consists of 150 instances, made up of  50 samples each of 3 species of iris. There were 4 features were measured from each sample. These were - the length and width of the sepals and the length and width of the petals. While one class  (or species) is linearly separable from the other 2; the others are NOT.

This dataset is commonly used for machine learning, particularly in statistical classification techniques. 
As Python contains the dataset in the Machine learning package Scikit-learn we will be importing it from there ( from sklearn.datasets import load_iris) 



The attributes of the dataset is as follows: 

1. Sepal length in cm's

2. Sepal width in cm's

3. Petal length in cm's 

4. Petal width in cm's 

5. Class:

   -Iris Setosa

   -Iris Versicolour

   -Iris Virginica
