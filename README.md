##  Dataset Information and Context

Fisher's Iris dataset was introduced by the statistician Ronald Fisher in a 1936 paper called "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis is the method used in statistics and other fields to find a linear combination of features that characterises or seperates two or more classes of objects or events. Fisher also was responsible for the development of the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test.   
The dataset consists of 150 instances, made up of  50 samples each of 3 species of iris. There were 4 features measured from each sample. These were - the length and width of the sepals and the length and width of the petals.
While one class  (or species) is linearly separable from the other 2; the others are NOT.

This dataset is commonly used for machine learning, particularly in statistical classification techniques. It is widely considered to be a good option for illustrating problems in the areas of statistical graphics, multivariate statistics and machine learning. It comprises of real, good quality data, in a small but meaningful dataset which offers a simple but challenging tast of discriminating between various types. In fact it is so popular that the dataset is readily available through the scikit-learn package, used in machine learning. 



### The attributes of the dataset is as follows: 

1. Sepal length in cm's

2. Sepal width in cm's

3. Petal length in cm's 

4. Petal width in cm's 

5. Class:

   -Iris Setosa

   -Iris Versicolour

   -Iris Virginica 
   
## Dataset Analysis

### Libraries Used
- ```NumPy``` imported as ```np``` 
- ```pandas``` imported as ```pd```
- ```seaborn``` imported as ```sns```
- ```matplotlib.pyplot``` imported as ```plt```

- ```NumPy``` is a module which  supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and provides large collection of high-level mathematical functions which can be used on these arrays

- ```pandas``` is a high-level, powerful module used for real-world data analysis and data manipulation. It provides fast, flexible and expressive data structures          designed to make working with data both easy and intuitive 

- ```seaborn``` is a Python data visualisation library based on matplotlib that offers less-dated choices for plot style and color defaults than matplotlib, defines       simple high-level functions for common statistical plot types, and integrates with the functionality provided by Pandas DataFrames.

- ```matplotlib``` is a module for static, interactive & animated visualisations allowing high levels of customisation and the embedding of plots into applications; and   pyplot provides a MATLAB-like interface within this module. 

All of the above were pre-installed in python using anaconda. 

### Dataset 

 The dataset was retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris as a csv (comma seperated values) file and imported into the program as follows: 

  ``` python
  
  iris = pd.read ("iris_csv.csv")
  
  ```

  I also created the output file:
   ``` python 
   out = open("summary_file_text_output.txt", "w")
   ```

 At this point I also performed a sanity check to ensure that there was no issues with the import of the libraries and to ensure that the read in of the dataset was problem-free.

 ### Basic Analysis

 I ran ```shape()``` to get the parameters of the data file, important for understanding the scope of the dataframe.

 ``` python
 print ("This is the shape of the datafile:\n(first number denotes the number of rows, the second the number of columns)", file = out)
print (iris.shape, file = out)
print ("",file = out)
print ("", file = out)
 ```

This returned the following output which demonstrates that the datafile is 150 rows and 5 columns wide:

 I also used ```head()``` to demonstrate the layout of the file, and the various names of the variables 

``` python

print("General layout of Fisher's Iris datafile:", file = out)
print(iris.head(5), file = out)
print ("", file = out)
print ("", file = out)
```

Which returns the following details: 

![](https://github.com/kaob1991/pands-project2021/blob/13a5198bb8aaf833a1aa79d435061477ab345a04/head.png)

We can see from the output it shows that there are 5 variables, and 4 of them are of type float (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width), and one string which is the species type. 


Running the data through ```describe()``` returned a basic numerical summary of the data containing the mean, max, standard deviation etc of the data file 
```python
print("Numerical summary of the datatypes:", file = out)
print(iris.describe(), file = out)
print ("", file = out)
print ("", file = out)
```

This returned the following: 

![](https://github.com/kaob1991/pands-project2021/blob/13a5198bb8aaf833a1aa79d435061477ab345a04/describe.png)

Looking at the Standard Deviation we can see that it is relatively low for 3 of the 4 variable types ( petal width, sepal length, sepal width) with a number below 1. However the petal length has a higher standard deviation suggesting that there is more variabilty in the measurements of this particular variable than the others.


I established 3 different variable types ( 1 for each species of the flower) and also ran a numerical summary of each individual species, again using ```describe()```

```python
iris_set = iris.loc [iris ["class"] == "Iris-setosa"]
iris_ver = iris.loc [iris ["class"] == "Iris-versicolor"]
iris_vir = iris.loc [iris ["class"] == "Iris-virginica" ]


print ("Numerical summary of the Iris Setosa", file = out)
print (iris_set.describe(), file = out)
print ("", file = out)
print ("Numerical summary of the Iris Versicolor", file = out)
print (iris_ver.describe(), file = out)
print ("", file = out)
print ("Numerical summary of the Iris Virginica", file = out)
print (iris_vir.describe(), file = out)
print ("", file = out)
print ("", file = out)
```

This returns the output for each individual species types: 

![](https://github.com/kaob1991/pands-project2021/blob/13a5198bb8aaf833a1aa79d435061477ab345a04/describe%20iris.png)

It gives a nice idea of the average real-life sizes of the flowers. It can be seen that, on average, the Iris Setosa has a large sepal compared to the petal, whereas the Iris Virgincia and Versicolor's petals and sepals are closer in size. 


Finally, I completed a correlation on the datafile using ```corr()``` to demonstrate the relationship between the variables. This produces the relationship between them on a scale between 0 and 1, with 0 being no retaionship detected, and 1 being a perfect correlation. 

```python
print ("Correlation table between the various data types:", file = out)
print (iris.corr(), file = out) 
```

The results are as follows: 

![](https://github.com/kaob1991/pands-project2021/blob/13a5198bb8aaf833a1aa79d435061477ab345a04/correlation.png)


Looking at the data, it shows a high level of correlation between petal length and petal width (.962757) and also, to a lesser extent, between sepal length and petal length (.871754); and sepal length and petal width (.817954). We shall explore the following data further in the plotting investigations below. 

I also ran a correlation on the individual species's variables to explore the levels of correlation within. 

```python

print ("Correlation table within the Iris Setosa species", file = out)
print (iris_set.corr(), file = out)
print ("", file = out)
print ("Correlation table within the Iris Versicolor species", file = out)
print (iris_ver.corr(), file = out)
print ("", file = out)
print ("Correlation table within the Iris Virginica species", file = out)
print (iris_vir.corr(), file = out)
print ("", file = out)
```

The results show the following:
- Low/Moderate levels of correlation in Iris Setosa between the variables with the exception of the sepal width andlength which has a level of .746780
- High level of correlation in Iris versicolor betweeen the petal length and petal width (.786668) and petal length and sepal length (.754049)
- Low/ Moderate levels of correlation in Irish Virginica between the variables with the exception of petal length and sepal length (.864225)
